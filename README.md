# Impact of Data Cleanliness on ML Analysis  

This project explores the influence of data cleanliness on machine learning performance using the **MTBLS90 dataset** from the [PIVUS project](https://github.com/shubhangi-9595/Classification---SVM-PCR-Random-Forest---PIVUS-dataset/blob/main/MTBLS90.xlsx).  

Corrupted datasets were generated by introducing **10% and 50% missing (NaN) values** and **10% and 50% incorrect values**. These datasets were then cleaned using **mean and median imputation**.  

## Dataset  
- **Data Sheet:** Contains 189 metabolite concentrations along with metadata (`Idx`, `SampleID`, `Class`, `Sex`).  
- **Peak Sheet:** Contains metadata for each metabolite.  

## Machine Learning Methods  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Linear:** Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.  
- **Principal Component Regression (PCR):** Uses principal components from PCA to predict outcomes.  

Datasets were split into training (66.67%) and testing (33.33%) sets, and ML methods were applied to identify key metabolites.  

The results of the analysis, including the effect of data corruption and cleaning on ML performance, can be found in the project report.
